Hey listen, this has nothing to do with the gender of **people** and
everything to do with the gender of **nouns**.

# Genderizer

**Genderizer** is a Chrome extension that helps advanced language learners
build stronger associations between nouns and their gender by color-coding
them in the browser. It currently offers German and Spanish language support,
and the colors are fully customizable to your preference and accessibility
needs.

## Installation

Genderizer is not yet available in the Chrome Web Store, but you can still try
it out:
1. Download or clone this repo using the green Code button at the top of this
   page
2. Put your Chrome extensions in developer mode using the toggle at the upper
   right of the extensions page
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and point it at the directory where you put the
   Genderizer repo

## Use
When Genderizer is on, it auto-detects the language of each page as it loads and will colorize if the text contains one of the languages Genderizer currently supports.

You can control Genderizer's behavior by clicking its icon in your browser. In
this menu, you can toggle Genderizer on and off and select custom colors.
Clicking Save will reload your current tab and re-colorize using your new
selections, while Reset will restore the original default colors.
